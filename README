# Data Cryptographer Bundle


## Synopsis

The Data Cryptographer Bundle is a PHP/Symfony bundle which provides a cryptographer resource/service for common cryptographic operations:
    - data hash (digest/integrity code)
    - key derivation/hash
    - data MAC (authentication code)
    - data en/decipherment (encryption/decryption)

Along matching Doctrine/DBAL data types:
    - hash_string
    - keyhash_string
    - cipher_string/cipher_text
which allow to transparently perform the given cryptographic operations on data being persisted/retrieved to/from database.
